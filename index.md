# Permutation Feature Importance: A Comprehensive Experiment Guide
_By Francesco Orsi_

## Overview

Permutation Feature Importance (PFI) is a widely adopted, model-agnostic technique for quantifying the importance of input features to a predictive model. It provides insights into which features most influence a modelâ€™s predictions by observing the degradation in performance when a feature's values are randomly shuffled.

This guide provides a **detailed, reproducible experiment protocol** for computing and interpreting Permutation Feature Importance, suitable for practitioners and researchers aiming for robust model explainability.

## Introduction

Feature importance methods help to demystify complex machine learning models, making them interpretable. Permutation Feature Importance works by **breaking the relationship** between a feature and the target variable, observing how model performance drops as a result.

**Key characteristics of PFI:**
- Model-agnostic: Works with any predictive model.
- Easy to implement.
- Provides quantitative importance scores.
- Measures **global importance** (averaged across the dataset).

## Mathematical Background

Let:
- \( f \) be the predictive model.
- \( X \) the dataset of input features.
- \( y \) the target vector.
- \( M \) a performance metric (e.g., accuracy, RMSE, F1 score).

### Steps:
1. **Compute the baseline performance:**
   \[
   M_{baseline} = M(f(X), y)
   \]

2. **For each feature \( X_j \):**
   - Shuffle its values to break its correlation with \( y \), creating \( X_{perm(j)} \).
   - Evaluate model performance:
     \[
     M_{perm(j)} = M(f(X_{perm(j)}), y)
     \]
   - The feature importance is computed as:
     \[
     I_j = M_{perm(j)} - M_{baseline}
     \]
   - For loss functions, importance is typically the **increase in error**. For scoring functions, it's the **decrease in score**.

## Experimental Setup

### 1. **Data Preparation**
   - Use a representative and clean test set.
   - Ensure feature types (categorical, numerical) are properly encoded.
   - Normalize if required by your model.

### 2. **Model Selection**
   - Train your predictive model on the training set.
   - Freeze the trained model during the PFI calculation.

### 3. **Performance Metric**
   - Select a metric suitable for your task:
     - Classification: Accuracy, F1, ROC AUC.
     - Regression: RMSE, MAE, \( R^2 \).

### 4. **Repetition and Averaging**
   - Repeat the permutation and evaluation process \( N \) times to account for randomness.
   - Average the importance scores over repetitions.

## Implementation Guidelines

### Python Example (Scikit-learn)

```python
from sklearn.inspection import permutation_importance
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Assume model, X_test, y_test are predefined

result = permutation_importance(model, X_test, y_test,
                                scoring='accuracy', n_repeats=10,
                                random_state=42, n_jobs=-1)

# Plotting
sorted_idx = result.importances_mean.argsort()

plt.barh(range(len(sorted_idx)), result.importances_mean[sorted_idx])
plt.yticks(range(len(sorted_idx)), [X_test.columns[i] for i in sorted_idx])
plt.xlabel("Permutation Importance")
plt.title("Feature Importance (Permutation)")
plt.show()
