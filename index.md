# Permutation Feature Importance: A Comprehensive Experiment Guide
_By Francesco Orsi_

## Overview

Permutation Feature Importance (PFI) is a model-agnostic approach for quantifying how much each input feature contributes to a predictive modelâ€™s performance. It works by randomly shuffling a feature's values and measuring the degradation in the model's performance.

This page provides a **comprehensive experiment protocol** and **theoretical background** to help you implement and interpret Permutation Feature Importance results accurately.

## Introduction

PFI quantifies the importance of a feature by **breaking its relationship with the target** and observing how the model's predictive performance changes.

**Advantages:**
- Model-agnostic
- Simple to implement
- Works with any performance metric
- Provides a global view of feature importance across the whole dataset

## Mathematical Background

Let:
- $f$ be a predictive model,
- $X$ be the input dataset,
- $y$ be the target variable,
- $M$ be a performance metric such as accuracy, RMSE, or F1 score.

### Baseline Performance

Compute the baseline performance of the model on the unshuffled data:

$$
M_{\text{baseline}} = M(f(X), y)
$$

### Feature-wise Importance

For each feature $X_j$:

1. Randomly shuffle $X_j$ to destroy its association with $y$, producing a new dataset $X^{(j)}_{\text{perm}}$.
2. Compute the model performance on the permuted dataset:

$$
M_{\text{perm}(j)} = M(f(X^{(j)}_{\text{perm}}), y)
$$

3. Calculate the importance of $X_j$ as the difference:

$$
I_j = M_{\text{perm}(j)} - M_{\text{baseline}}
$$

- If $M$ is a **loss** (e.g., RMSE), a **positive $I_j$** indicates the feature is important.
- If $M$ is a **score** (e.g., accuracy), you may compute:

$$
I_j = M_{\text{baseline}} - M_{\text{perm}(j)}
$$

so that a **positive $I_j$** again indicates importance.

## Experimental Setup

### 1. Data Preparation
- Prepare a **hold-out test set** representative of your problem domain.
- Ensure correct preprocessing (e.g., encoding categorical features, scaling if necessary).

### 2. Model Training
- Train your model on the training set.
- Keep the model **frozen** (no retraining during PFI).

### 3. Metric Selection
- Choose a performance metric that matches your use case:
    - Classification: accuracy, F1, ROC AUC
    - Regression: RMSE, MAE, $R^2$

### 4. Repeats and Averaging
- Shuffle and evaluate multiple times ($N$ permutations) to reduce randomness.
- Average the importance scores over repetitions.

## Implementation Guidelines

### Python Example (Scikit-learn)

```python
from sklearn.inspection import permutation_importance
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Assume model, X_test, y_test are predefined

result = permutation_importance(model, X_test, y_test,
                                scoring='accuracy', n_repeats=10,
                                random_state=42, n_jobs=-1)

# Plotting
sorted_idx = result.importances_mean.argsort()

plt.barh(range(len(sorted_idx)), result.importances_mean[sorted_idx])
plt.yticks(range(len(sorted_idx)), [X_test.columns[i] for i in sorted_idx])
plt.xlabel("Permutation Importance")
plt.title("Feature Importance (Permutation)")
plt.show()
