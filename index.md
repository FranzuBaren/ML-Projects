# Permutation Feature Importance: A Comprehensive Experiment Guide
_By Francesco Orsi_

## Overview

Permutation Feature Importance (PFI) is a model-agnostic approach for quantifying how much each input feature contributes to a predictive modelâ€™s performance. It works by randomly shuffling a feature's values and measuring the degradation in the model's performance.

This page provides a **comprehensive experiment protocol** and **theoretical background** to help you implement and interpret Permutation Feature Importance results accurately.

## Introduction

PFI quantifies the importance of a feature by **breaking its relationship with the target** and observing how the model's predictive performance changes.

**Advantages:**
- Model-agnostic
- Simple to implement
- Works with any performance metric
- Provides a global view of feature importance across the whole dataset

## Mathematical Background

Let:
- \( f \) be a predictive model,
- \( X \) be the input dataset,
- \( y \) be the target variable,
- \( M \) be a performance metric such as accuracy, RMSE, or F1 score.

### Baseline Performance

Compute the baseline performance of the model on the unshuffled data:

$$
M_{\text{baseline}} = M(f(X), y)
$$

### Feature-wise Importance

For each feature \( X_j \):
1. Randomly shuffle \( X_j \) to destroy its association with \( y \), producing a new dataset \( X^{(j)}_{\text{perm}} \).
2. Compute the model performance on the permuted dataset:

$$
M_{\text{perm}(j)} = M(f(X^{(j)}_{\text{perm}}), y)
$$

3. Calculate the importance of \( X_j \) as the difference:

$$
I_j = M_{\text{perm}(j)} - M_{\text{baseline}}
$$

- If \( M \) is a **loss** (e.g., RMSE), a **positive \( I_j \)** i**_**
